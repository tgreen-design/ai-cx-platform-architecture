- Technology: $0.69 (7%)
- Facilities: $0.60 (6%)
- Overhead: $0.73 (8%)
- **Total: $9.40**

**AI-Hybrid Model:**

| Tier | % Volume | Cost Components | Total Cost |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Tier 1 (AI) | 70% | Platform $0.45 + Dev $0.30 + Infra $0.10 | **$0.85** |

- Limited by labor market and training capacity

**AI-Hybrid Model (Sub-linear Scaling):**
- 50% volume increase → 15% cost increase
- AI handles incremental volume with minimal marginal cost
- Agent hiring grows at 1/3 the rate of volume

**Example: Doubling Volume in Year 4**

Traditional:
- Volume: 11M interactions
- Agents needed: 628
- Total cost: $51.6M
- Cost per interaction: $9.40

AI-Hybrid:
- Volume: 11M interactions
- Agents needed: 220 (only 47% increase from Year 3)
- Total cost: $22.8M (only 37% increase from Year 3)
- Cost per interaction: $2.07 (10% improvement)
- **Savings: $28.8M annually**
